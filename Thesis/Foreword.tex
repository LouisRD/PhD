Writing this thesis was not tremendously challenging because the ideas were too complex, or because I did not know what I wanted to say, or because the train of thought was too sophisticated, or because it was too strenuous. It was difficult because I suffered immensely during the research years. What happened during my doctoral research years connected to deep emotional scars that never healed. 

Before being able to write with positive tone and intention, I had to take care of my wounds first. I had to grow emotionally to be the person I wanted to be and not the sentiment slave I was. I was a master at avoiding my inner fears and sorrow. 

My ambition at becoming whole again started at the birth of Chloé. My first child. Without her I would have not overcome my horrible demons. Without her I would have quit my doctorate with more pain and anger than before. 

My doctorate thesis is dedicated to you my lovely child, Chloé.
